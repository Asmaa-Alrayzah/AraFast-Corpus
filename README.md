# AraFast: Developing and Evaluating a Comprehensive Modern Standard Arabic Corpus for Enhanced Natural Language Processing 

## Description
This corpus is primarily aimed at to offer a free Arabic corpus to be used in a variety of NLP tasks and language modeling. The corpus should be a useful resource for language modeling and text generation. By training language models on it, researchers can develop Arabic language models without spending time collecting training data. Researchers can also use it to improve the generation of contextually appropriate Arabic text. This has implications for various applications, such as chatbots, question-answering, summarization, and Arabic text generation.
