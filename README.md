# AraFast: Developing and Evaluating a Comprehensive Modern Standard Arabic Corpus for Enhanced Natural Language Processing 

## Description
This corpus is primarily aimed at to offer a free Arabic corpus to be used in a variety of NLP tasks and language modeling. The corpus should be a useful resource for language modeling and text generation. By training language models on it, researchers can develop Arabic language models without spending time collecting training data. Researchers can also use it to improve the generation of contextually appropriate Arabic text. This has implications for various applications, such as chatbots, question-answering, summarization, and Arabic text generation.

## Accessing the Corpus
The corpus is hosted on Google Drive and can be accessed through this link: [Google Drive Link ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ewClbL60HWcGT1AHmulb9SGSZ-DzjR5m?usp=share_link). <br> 
The total size of the corpus is approximately 48GB, which is permitted for publication, and all files are available in TXT format.

## Note:
About 65GB of the OSCAR corpus is not published. Please ask the OSCAR organization for permission, and apply the same process of Algorithm 1 in our paper "AraFast: Developing and Evaluating a Comprehensive Modern Standard Arabic Corpus for Enhanced Natural Language Processing" to obtain the same result.<br>

## How to Use
To use the publicly accessible Arabic AraFast corpus in Google Colab, you'll first need to add the corpus to your own Google Drive. <br>
Adding the Corpus to Your Google Drive: <br>
1-	Open the Shared Folder: Go to the shared corpus link. <br>
2-	Add to Your Drive: Right-click on the folder or use the dropdown menu and select 'Add shortcut to Drive'. Choose a location in your drive to create a shortcut to the folder.
